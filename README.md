# PyTorch Web Deploy

Simple, fast web deployment for your Pytorch models

## How to use this?

### Use this as a template for deploying your models

### Step 1

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NirantK/pytorch-web-deploy.git
```

### Step 2

- Update your training script in ```src/models/train_model.py``` and model in ```src/models/model_class.py``` run the script to save model weights
- For above, there is sample code already in those files, which you can use to get started
- Replace your model in ```src/models/model_class.py```
- Replace the model weights in ```models/*.pt```

### Step 3

- Start Webserver and check API endpoints with ```demo_request.py```, it is already written with one image at a time
- Go to ```localhost:5000``` and get started!

That's it, done!
